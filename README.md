# Platzigram Api

### Description

Platzigram is a social network similar to instagram, created by platzi and developed during his courses; this project is a tribute to platzigram, because thanks to it I learned Django and therefore it occurred to me that it was a great idea to create an api so that it could be used in pages, mobile applications ... as a webservice.

### How do I start using it?

{% page-ref page="users/signup.md" %}
